# Digimon-api

In this task, I create a constructor to generate a Digimon objects.
Also, hit the provided api and read the data from it using fetch method and create 20 object from the retrieve data then push them to an array.
And loop through the array using for and create a card for each object to render in the main.

- - I have to add style for page & using map rather than for loop.
